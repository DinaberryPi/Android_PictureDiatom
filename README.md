## App Description
This app uses Google Teachable Machine to identify and classify diatoms from an input image. It can determine if the diatom is Centric, Araphid, Eunotioid, or Surirelloid.

## How it works
Upload an image containing a diatom to the app's interface, and the app will use machine learning to analyze and classify the diatom into one of the four categories.

## Limitations
The model may not always correctly identify or classify diatoms, and may be impacted by the quality of the input image.

## Future Development
In the future, we aim to expand the app's capabilities to identify and classify even more types of diatoms, potentially including additional genera or species. We also plan to improve the accuracy of the model by training it on larger and more diverse datasets. Finally, we hope to make the app more user-friendly by implementing a more intuitive interface and providing detailed information on the classification process.
