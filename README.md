## App Description
This app not only captures diatom photos but also performs species classification. I trained a discriminative AI model using Google Teachable Machine, developed an Android app for capturing photos, and seamlessly integrated the AI model into the app. As a result, users can enjoy real-time diatom species identification within the application.

## How it works
Upload an image containing a diatom to the app's interface, and the app will use machine learning to analyze and classify the diatom into one of the four categories.

## Limitations
The model may not always correctly identify or classify diatoms and may be impacted by the quality of the input image.

## Future Development
In the future, I aim to expand the app's capabilities to identify and classify even more types of diatoms, potentially including additional genera or species. We also plan to improve the model's accuracy by training it on more extensive and diverse datasets. Finally, we hope to make the app more user-friendly by implementing a more intuitive interface and providing detailed information on the classification process.
